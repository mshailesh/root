If you want to extend the document sharing system to support sharing documents with multiple Line of Business (LOB) entities, you can enhance the system's permission model. Below is an extended technical flow for sharing documents with other LOBs while considering permissions:

### Technical Flow for Sharing with Other LOBs:

#### 1. **User Uploads Document:**

- **Frontend:**
  1. User initiates document upload through the frontend application.
  2. Frontend sends a document upload request to the backend.

- **Backend (DocumentService):**
  1. Receives the document upload request.
  2. Stores the document in GridFS (fs.files and fs.chunks collections).
  3. Associates metadata (user ID, timestamp) with the document.
  4. Sets default or user-specific permissions for the uploaded document, including permissions for the user's associated LOB.
  5. Responds to the frontend with a success message or document ID.

#### 2. **Bank Shares Document with User (Including LOBs):**

- **Frontend (Bank User Interface):**
  1. Bank user selects a document to share and specifies the target user and associated LOBs.
  2. Sends a document sharing request to the backend.

- **Backend (DocumentService):**
  1. Receives the document sharing request from the bank user.
  2. Updates the permissions associated with the shared document to include the target user and specified LOBs.
  3. Modifies the metadata in the fs.files collection to reflect the updated permissions.
  4. Responds to the frontend with a success message.

#### 3. **User Retrieves Document (Including LOBs):**

- **Frontend:**
  1. User requests to retrieve a specific document.
  2. Frontend sends a document retrieval request to the backend.

- **Backend (DocumentService):**
  1. Queries the fs.files collection to retrieve metadata associated with the requested document.
  2. Checks the user's permissions using the checkUserPermissions function, including checking LOB permissions.
  3. If the user has the required permissions:
      - Retrieves the document data from the fs.chunks collection.
      - Combines and decodes the chunks to reconstruct the original document.
      - Responds to the frontend with the reconstructed document data.
  4. If access is denied:
      - Responds to the frontend with an access denied message.

### Enhanced Components:

- **Frontend Application:**
  - Initiates and handles user interactions related to document upload, sharing, and retrieval.

- **Backend DocumentService:**
  - Manages document-related operations, including storage, sharing, and retrieval.
  - Interacts with GridFS to store and retrieve document data.

- **GridFS (fs.files and fs.chunks):**
  - Stores document data in a scalable manner.
  - Stores metadata and chunks associated with each document.

### Additional Considerations:

- **LOB Permissions:**
  - The system now considers permissions associated with specific LOBs when checking access rights.
  - LOBs can be dynamically managed and associated with users and documents.

- **Permission Model Extension:**
  - The permission model is extended to include not only individual users but also groups, such as LOBs.

- **Permission Editing:**
  - The system may provide interfaces for users to edit and manage document permissions, including LOBs.

This enhanced flow allows documents to be shared with specific LOBs, and users belonging to those LOBs can retrieve documents based on their permissions. The permissions can be as granular as needed, allowing for flexibility in document access management across different business entities.
